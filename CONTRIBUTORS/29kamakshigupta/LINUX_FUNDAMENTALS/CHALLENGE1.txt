The Flag: 
geek{grep_is_good_to_find_things_cEDf1591}

The Command: 
grep -o "geek{[^}]*}" file.1

Explanation: 
I used the wget command to download the data file. 
The grep command searches for patterns within files. 
I used the -o (only-matching) flag to isolate the flag 
from a massive "wall of text," as a standard search would
have printed the entire messy line. The pattern "geek{[^}]*}" 
specifically tells the terminal to find the "geek{" prefix and 
capture everything until the closing bracket, ignoring the surrounding 
random characters and making it easy to directly lookout for the flag.
